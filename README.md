Classifying Startups - A Predictive Model for Determining Success

This project focuses on developing predictive models that classify startups based on key performance indicators, enabling investors and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.The primary goal of this project was to predict the success of startups by measuring their likelihood of continued operation using publicly available Crunchbase data sourced from Kaggle. Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, were employed for the classification task. The analysis involved identifying key features influencing startup success in different scenarios and evaluating model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The findings provide insights into the factors driving startup success and highlight the comparative effectiveness of different classification models.
